# Overview 

TRA API is a rest API which allows authenticated users to submit data to and retrieve data from the TRA database. 

It primarily serves users of the TRA Mobile App, but will also be expanded in the future to serve TRA Analysis so that it can pull data 
from the API instead of from Mongo.
